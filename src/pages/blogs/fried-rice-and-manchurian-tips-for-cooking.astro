            id: "origins",
            content: "Fried rice was said to originate in China during the Sui Dynasty over 1,500 years ago. What started out as a clever way to make use of leftover rice has now transformed into a globally loved dish with countless variations. Manchurian, commonly linked with Indian-Chinese cuisine, is said to have evolved from India’s food capitals. It gained prominence because of Chinese settlers who blended Indian spices and ingredients with Chinese cooking, which gave birth to a dish that is extremely popular in South Asia. Now, fried rice and manchurian serve as a historic landmark of cultural fusion that shows the ingenuity of Asian cuisine. These can be found in fine dining places, street vendors, and even casual dining places such as Chinese restaurants like Vanchu Hut, which is located in Pratap Vihar, Ghaziabad. It is a go-to place for all the fans of these mouthwatering dishes."
